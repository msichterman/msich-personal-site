# Welcome to my Personal Site: [MSICH.DEV](https://msich.dev/)

My personal site includes my `portfolio` of work experience, resume, and projects, `about` me which lists my skills, education, and personal information, and a `contact` form to contact me directly. 

## Motivation
I created this site to create a home for my accomplishments and personal portfolio. I wanted to get some experience using Gatsby and enjoyed using Netlify to host the site. I originally built the site using [this starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/stackrole/gatsby-starter-foundation/) from *stackrole*. The original starter used Netlify as a CMS, but I adjusted it to use MDX in order to streamline it for my use-case. Overall, it was a great way to dip my toes into Gatsby and static-site generation with React.
