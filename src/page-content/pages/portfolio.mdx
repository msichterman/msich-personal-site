## Experience

<ExperienceList />

In addition to my experience at the companies above, I also take great pride in my
time as a student-athlete and how it has developed many of the skills that I have
been able to bring to industry.

- **Time management** is a skill I have had to develop,
  balancing up to 15 credit hours, investing more than 20 hours a week in football-related
  activities, and managing other development opportunities whenever else possible.
- **Communication** and **collaboration** with a diverse group of student-athletes
  and staff members has also aided greatly in my personal development, which has furthered
  my **leadership** and **teamwork** skills.
- Above all, being a student-athlete has taught me invaluable lessons about **discipline** and **hardwork**, two qualitites I strive to carry everywhere I go.
